				of the other sites, but the number of visitors is decreasing. Site 2 has a fairly constant number of visitors,
				while for Site 3 page hits are increasing month on month.

			<h3>Presentation</h3>
			<p>The bar chart represents both the number of visitors per month for each website, and the total number of visitors
				per website for the entire quarter. Website visitors for each month are represented using columns lined up
				horizontally, with heights indicating the number of visitors. A fourth column is provided for each website
				with the accumulated site visitors for the quarter.
