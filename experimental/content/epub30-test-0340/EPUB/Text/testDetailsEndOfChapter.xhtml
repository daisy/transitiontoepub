    <h2>Notes about techniques</h2>
    <p>In this chapter there are two examples. The extended descriptions are placed at the end of the chapter. It is expected that this approach will appeal to publishers that do not want the descriptions to  impact the appearance of the content. The approaches have the lowest impact on the visual layout. They both use <code>aria-details</code>, which points to a <code>div</code> at the end of the chapter, which eventually will be picked up by assistive technologies and reading systems to make navigation to the description a seamless experience. However, until <code>aria-details</code> is widely adopted, a traditional link is placed below the image that points to the same location at the end of the chapter. The bar chart has a text link and the peacock has an image as a link. A link back to the image is provided to take the reader back to the same location where they left off reading in the primary flow of content. </p>

    <p> In summary, the three techniques we are testing are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>aria-details</code> attribute.</li>
      <li>Text hyperlink to act as fallback if <code>aria-details</code> is not supported.</li>
      <li>Image hyperlink to act as fallback if <code>aria-details</code> is not supported.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Tests for bar chart image that uses <code>aria-details</code> for navigation to end of chapter description</h1>
    <p>The tests below refer to the bar chart image immediately following.</p>

    <section id="extdesc-070" class="test">
      <h2><span class="test-id">extdesc-070</span><span class="test-title">Detection of <code>aria-details</code></span></h2>
      <p class="desc">This test passes if <code>aria-details</code> for the image is reported. (For example, your screen reader will announce <q>has details</q>.)</p>
    </section>

    <section id="extdesc-080" class="test">
      <h2><span class="test-id">extdesc-080</span><span class="test-title">Linking to extended description at end of chapter</span></h2>
      <p class="desc">This test passes if you can use <code>aria-details</code> to take you to the description at the end of the chapter, under the heading "Description of Bar Chart". (For example your browser or screen reader may provide some shortcut key or an interactive element like button, link etc. for using <code>aria-details</code>.)</p>

        <img src="../Images/more_info.jpeg" alt="Follow link for extended description at end of chapter"  /></a>


  <h2>Complex Images (provided as filler)</h2>

  <p>We want to simulate that there is a lot of material between the images and the end of the chapter where the extended descriptions are placed. This provides that filler.</p>
  <p>Complex images contain substantial information; more details than can be conveyed in a short phrase or sentence. These are typically:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>graphs and charts, including flow charts and organizational charts;</li>
    <li>diagrams and illustrations where the page text relies on the user being able to understand the image;</li>
    <li>maps showing locations or other information such as weather systems.</li>
  </ul>

            while for Site 3 page hits are increasing month on month.</p>

        <p>The bar chart represents both the number of visitors per month for each website, and the total number of visitors
            per website for the entire quarter. Website visitors for each month are represented using columns lined up
            horizontally, with heights indicating the number of visitors. A fourth column is provided for each website
            with the accumulated site visitors for the quarter.</p>

    <h3>Description of Peacock</h3>
      <p>
          The male peacock is metallic blue on the crown, the feathers of the head being short and curled. The fan-shaped crest on
          the head is made of feathers with bare black shafts and tipped with blush-green webbing. A white stripe above
          the eye and a crescent shaped white patch below the eye are formed by bare white skin. The sides of the head
          have iridescent greenish blue feathers. The back has scaly bronze-green feathers with black and copper markings.
