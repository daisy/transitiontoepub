  <h1 id="s1">Extended description using <code>details</code> and <code>summary</code></h1>

  <h2>Notes about techniques</h2>

  <p>In the first image on this page, the HTML <code>details</code> and <code>summary</code> elements are used to expose the extended image descriptions directly within the <code>figcaption</code> for the image.</p>

  <p>In the second image, the HTML <code>details</code> and <code>summary</code> elements are used to expose the extended image descriptions directly under the image (<code>details</code> is placed after <code>img</code> element, as a sibling).</p>

  <p>In both images, <code>aria-details</code> also points to this details/summary structure, which eventually will be picked up by assistive technologies and reading systems to make this a seamless experience.</p>

  <p>The tests below refer to the bar chart image immediately following.</p>

                      than either of the other sites, but the number of visitors is decreasing. Site 2 has a fairly constant
                      number of visitors, while for Site 3 page hits are increasing month on month.</p>

                      columns lined up horizontally, with heights indicating the number of visitors. A fourth column is
                      provided for each website with the accumulated site visitors for the quarter.</p>
