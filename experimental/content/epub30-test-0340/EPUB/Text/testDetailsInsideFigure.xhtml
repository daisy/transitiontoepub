  <h1 id="s1">Extended description using <code>details</code> and <code>summary</code> inside Figure Element</h1>

  <h2>Notes about techniques</h2>

  <p>For the image on this page, the HTML <code>details</code> and <code>summary</code> elements are used to expose the extended image descriptions directly outside the <code>figcaption</code> but still within the <code>figure</code> element for the image.</p>

  <p>We have also included <code>aria-details</code> whcih points to this details/summary structure, which eventually will be picked up by assistive technologies and reading systems to make this a seamless experience.</p>

  <p>The test below refer to the bar chart image immediately following.</p>

   <section id="extdesc-240" class="test">
    <h2><span class="test-id">extdesc-240</span><span class="test-title">Detection and utilization of <code>details</code> and <code>summary</code> elements</span> inside <code>figure</code> element but outside the <code>figcaption</code> </h2>
    <p class="desc">This test passes if all the following steps are successful:</p>

    <ol>
<li>The HTML <code>details/summary</code> elements are reported. (For example, there is an interactive element like button, link etc. that you can activate.)</li>
<li>You can expand and collapse the <code>details</code> element containing the extended description. (For example, you can activate the interactive element to expand or collapse the extended description.)</li>
<li>When expanded, the extended description should appear immediately after the activating element. When you collapse it, you should remain at the same position.</li>
<li>The table within the extended description in the details is accessible to assistive technologies and is navigable.</li>
</ol>

                  <p>The chart shows the website hits for the first quarter of 2014. It shows that Site 1 has more visitors
                      than either of the other sites, but the number of visitors is decreasing. Site 2 has a fairly constant
                      number of visitors, while for Site 3 page hits are increasing month on month.</p>

            <h3>Presentation</h3>
                  <p>The bar chart represents both the number of visitors per month for each website, and the total number
                      of visitors per website for the entire quarter. Website visitors for each month are represented using
                      columns lined up horizontally, with heights indicating the number of visitors. A fourth column is
                      provided for each website with the accumulated site visitors for the quarter.</p>
