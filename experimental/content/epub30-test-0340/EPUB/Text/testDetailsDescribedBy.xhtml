    <h1 id="s1">Extended descriptions using ARIA <code>described-by</code> pointing to a visually hidden aside</h1>

    <h2>Notes about techniques</h2>
    <p>In the following examples, the <code>aria-describedby</code> attribute is used to expose the extended image description, which is in an <code>aside</code> element.</p>

    <p>In the first example, <code>aria-describedby</code> points to an <code>aside</code> element, placed inside a <code>figcaption</code> element.</p>

    <p>In the second example, the head of the peacock is described using a paragraph of text that is in an aside on the web page.</p>

    <p><em>Note:</em></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Since <code>aria-describedby</code> will flatten all the extended image description text, we believe the table within the extended image description will not be navigable using AT.</li>
      <li>Since the description is hidden visually, this solution is not recommended for universal accessibility because the description will not be available to low vision users and people with learning disabilities.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The test below refers to the bar chart image immediately following.</p>
    <section id="extdesc-110" class="test">
      <h2><span class="test-id">extdesc-110</span><span class="test-title"><code>aria-describedby</code> points to an <code>aside</code> in a <code>figcaption</code></span></h2>
      <div class="desc">
        <p>The test passes if you are able to read/hear the following text when the focus is on the image. (You should be able to read it before reaching the horizontal break):</p>
        <blockquote>Extended Description Overview<br />
		The chart shows the website hits for the first quarter of 2014. It shows that Site 1 has more visitors than either of the other sites, but the number of visitors is decreasing. Site 2 has a fairly constant number of visitors, while for Site 3 page hits are increasing month on month.
        </blockquote>
        <p>Note: there may be a lot more text read that is in a table.</p>
		<p>Note for screen reader users: It is possible that your screen reader reads the text inside aria-describedby before reporting the image. In such a case, please provide your experience in the notes.</p>

                <p>The bar chart represents both the number of visitors per month for each website, and the total number of
                    visitors per website for the entire quarter. Website visitors for each month are represented using columns
                    lined up horizontally, with heights indicating the number of visitors. A fourth column is provided for
                    each website with the accumulated site visitors for the quarter.</p>
