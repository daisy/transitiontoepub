			<h3>Overview</h3>
			<p>The chart shows the website hits for the first quarter of 2014. It shows that Site 1 has more visitors than either
				of the other sites, but the number of visitors is decreasing. Site 2 has a fairly constant number of visitors,
				while for Site 3 page hits are increasing month on month.

			<h3>Presentation</h3>
			<p>The bar chart represents both the number of visitors per month for each website, and the total number of visitors
				per website for the entire quarter. Website visitors for each month are represented using columns lined up
				horizontally, with heights indicating the number of visitors. A fourth column is provided for each website
				with the accumulated site visitors for the quarter.

			<h2>Description of Heart and Lung Diagram</h2>

			<p>Systems in Sync. The circulatory and respiratory systems work together to transport oxygen-rich blood through the body.</p>
			<p>A diagram shows a cross-section of a heart between two lungs. Red arrows show the path of oxygen-rich blood cells. Blue arrows show the path of oxygen-poor blood.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Oxygen-rich blood cells travel to the heart from the lungs.</li>
				<li>The heart pumps enriched blood cells. They travel through the arteries to the body.</li>
				<li>Throughout the body, red blood cells deliver oxygen to cells and remove carbon dioxide.</li>
				<li>Veins carry oxygen-poor blood back to the heart.</li>
				<li>The heart pumps blood back to the lungs to eliminate carbon dioxide and absorb oxygen.</li>
				<li>Red blood cells move through the lungs, taking in oxygen and exchanging it for carbon dioxide.</li>
