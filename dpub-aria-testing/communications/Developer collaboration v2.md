# Developer Collaboration Request for DPUB-ARIA

Last updated: September 1, 2021

## Background

The Transition to Accessible EPUB 3 DAISY working group in conjunction with Benetech, LIA, and other leaders in the field of document access are seeking collaboration from targeted companies to help in the implementation of the DPUB-ARIA roles. The DPUB-ARIA roles version 1.0 is a W3C recommendation, and we want to encourage its widespread adoption across all browsers and EPUB reading systems and Apps. Find the specification at: [https://www.w3.org/TR/dpub-aria-1.0/](https://www.w3.org/TR/dpub-aria-1.0/)

## What we have Done

- Developed a suggested, semantic, spoken representation for screen reader and other AT vendors.
- Tested the browsers to determine if they are exposing the DPUB-ARIA roles.
- Tested the browsers and AT combinations to determine what they are speaking now.
- Tested important reading systems with AT to determine what is being presented.
- Created a report with all the information.

## Our Ask

- We are asking browser developers to review our results in the hopes of improving what is presented by AT. Where there is missing information necessary for AT to present the semantic information, we are asking the browser developers to fix the issues.

- We are asking EPUB Reading System developers to review the results and correct any areas where the reading system is not delivering the DPUB-ARIA semantic information and making it available to AT.

- We are asking AT developers to review the suggested output we have developed. We understand this is not a requirement and is only a suggestion. We have only made this information available in English.
