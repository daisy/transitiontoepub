  <p class="para"><span class="para-id" id="workid-USAC0029927-book-part-4-target-3"></span>Before beginning to develop the claims of this book, I want to provide a review of how theatre has previously been conceived.<a role="doc-noteref" class="endNote" epub:type="noteref" href="#workid-USAC0029927-book-part-4-fn-1" id="fn_workid-USAC0029927-book-part-4-fn-1">*</a> However, even before I venture forth to amass a collection of thoughts by others, I would say that I should establish what I mean, generally, by “theatre,” as how I define it here helps us understand the purview of the present book. I will invoke and examine two general types of theatre which I am including under the umbrella of “theatre”: (1) plays that have a dramatic text and whose theatrical performance are based on<a role="doc-noteref" class="endNote" href="workid-USAC0029927-book-part-13.xhtml#workid-USAC0029927-book-part-13-fn-4" id="fn_workid-USAC0029927-book-part-13-fn-4"><sup>1</sup></a> the dramatic text (e.g., traditional text-based theatre) and (2) performances based on some form of script (broadly defined) that are billed as, or implied to be, theatre that are staged in a theatre venue or designated theatre space (e.g., site-specific performances, one-person shows, devised theatre, docudrama, verbatim theatre, etc.). Both of these types give a lot of wiggle room in which plays and performances fall under this two-pronged umbrella, as these two are certainly not hermetically sealed, nor even quite accepted, categories. However, the very nature of art, broadly defined, is in a constant state of change, as iconoclasts of each art form both expand the categories and also delimit and/or delineate these categories through creating a sufficient-enough departure from the previously understood categories (<a role="doc-biblioref" class="link_bibr" href="workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1.xhtml#workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1-ref-146" id="Ref_workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1-ref-146_1">Bennett 2017</a>: 19–21).</p>
<p class="para indented" data-content-type="indented"><span class="para-id" id="workid-USAC0029927-book-part-4-target-4"></span>Theatre—that is, traditional text-based theatre—is widely considered the art form that most closely resembles lived life: real bodies in real space play out a story through the actual passage of time. Because of this, theatre has long been a laboratory of, and for, <span aria-label="16" class="page" epub:type="pagebreak" id="workid-USAC0029927-book-part-4-target-026" role="doc-pagebreak" title="16"></span>philosophical thought and reflection. The study of philosophy and theatre has a history that dates to, and flourished in, ancient Greece and Rome. While philosophers over the centuries have revisited the study of theatre, in particular, the past four decades have seen a noted and substantial increase of scholarship investigating the intersection of philosophy and theatre.</p>
<p class="para indented" data-content-type="indented"><span class="para-id" id="workid-USAC0029927-book-part-4-target-5"></span>“Philosophy of theatre” is, on one hand, an amorphous concept; on the other hand, it is an ever-growing, recognized subfield both of analytic aesthetics and of theatre and performance studies. Philosophy of theatre is also sometimes referred to—or subsumed, more broadly, within—an emerging field called “performance philosophy.” Whatever we aim to call the field, scholarship has coalesced around some fundamental preoccupations, which are not too dissimilar to questions that arise in other philosophies of [<i>fill-in-the-blank</i>] (e.g., art, music, film, dance, etc.). The debates in philosophy of theatre mostly fall into three branches of philosophy: ontology, epistemology, and aesthetics.</p>
<p class="para indented" data-content-type="indented"><span class="para-id" id="workid-USAC0029927-book-part-4-target-6"></span>The major ontological debates center on liveness and the ephemeral nature of theatre, as well as the question, What is theatre? Epistemological studies examine audience reception and how meaning is made and/or transmitted. Finally, studies in aesthetics focus on two main questions: What is the relationship between dramatic text and theatrical performance? and What is the value of theatre? Like many in academia who are either in philosophy or feel its touch, philosophy of theatre is not without its principal divisions along the analytic-Continental lines. More particular to philosophy of theatre, a second division finds those aligned by who focus primarily on either the dramatic text (often, in literature departments) or the practice/production of theatrical performance (often, in theatre and/or performance departments).</p>

Plato and Aristotle had ideas about mimesis and imitation, and this was taken up again in the 1960s (by Auerbach, most notably). There is also significant, though not fully direct commentary about this, much from the field of aesthetics, on questions of representation in the arts (e.g., <a role="doc-biblioref" class="link_bibr" href="workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1.xhtml#workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1-ref-0104" id="Ref_workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1-ref-0104">Goodman 1968</a>, 1978; <a role="doc-biblioref" class="link_bibr" href="workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1.xhtml#workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1-ref-239" id="Ref_workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1-ref-239">Walton 1990</a>; <a role="doc-biblioref" class="link_bibr" href="workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1.xhtml#workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1-ref-244" id="Ref_workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1-ref-244">Wollheim 1980</a>). Questions about the ontology of theatre have been raised via modal logic, particularly the “possible worlds” thesis (<a role="doc-biblioref" class="link_bibr" href="workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1.xhtml#workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1-ref-63" id="Ref_workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1-ref-63">Degani-Raz 2003</a>, 2005; <a role="doc-biblioref" class="link_bibr" href="workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1.xhtml#workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1-ref-146" id="Ref_workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1-ref-146_2">Bennett 2017</a>), which looked back to studies on fictional entities (too numerous to mention here, but the major texts are, as relating to philosophy of theatre, <a role="doc-biblioref" class="link_bibr" href="workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1.xhtml#workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1-ref-134" id="Ref_workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1-ref-134">Kripke 1980</a>, 2011; <a role="doc-biblioref" class="link_bibr" href="workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1.xhtml#workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1-ref-174" id="Ref_workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1-ref-174">Pavel 1985</a>; and <a role="doc-biblioref" class="link_bibr" href="workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1.xhtml#workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1-ref-230" id="Ref_workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1-ref-230">Thomasson 1999</a>). As theatre happens in front of an audience, What is an audience? is another question that is ontologically oriented toward the theatre. Studies have examined the necessity of audience, the relationship between audience and actors, and the composition of audience (e.g., <a role="doc-biblioref" class="link_bibr" href="workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1.xhtml#workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1-ref-26" id="Ref_workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1-ref-26">Blau 1990</a>; S. <a role="doc-biblioref" class="link_bibr" href="workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1.xhtml#workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1-ref-23" id="Ref_workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1-ref-23">Bennett 1990</a>; <a role="doc-biblioref" class="link_bibr" href="workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1.xhtml#workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1-ref-18" id="Ref_workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1-ref-18">Bennett 2012</a>). Finally, given that theatre happens in the “here and now,” one of the central issues to philosophy of theatre concerns “liveness” and ephemerality: from debates as to whether or how to document theatre (Phalen 1993; <a role="doc-biblioref" class="link_bibr" href="workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1.xhtml#workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1-ref-9" id="Ref_workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1-ref-9">Auslander 1999</a>) to the idea of “ghosting” (Carlson 2003) to trying to describe the nature of the ephemeral (<a role="doc-biblioref" class="link_bibr" href="workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1.xhtml#workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1-ref-218" id="Ref_workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1-ref-218">States 1983</a>, 1985; <a role="doc-biblioref" class="link_bibr" href="workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1.xhtml#workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1-ref-245" id="Ref_workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1-ref-245">Zarrilli 2004</a>; Fischer-Lichte 1992, 2008).</p></div><div class="sec" id="workid-USAC0029927-book-part-4-sec-4"><header><h3 class="header sec hLevel3"><span class="title sec"><span class="para-id" id="workid-USAC0029927-book-part-4-target-10"></span>Epistemology of Theatre</span></h3></header><p class="para"><span class="para-id" id="workid-USAC0029927-book-part-4-target-11"></span>Meaning and interpretation have been central to the industry of professional theatre scholarship.

Two related questions occupied, and still occupy, philosophy of theatre: reception studies and reading texts versus “reading” performance (e.g., <a role="doc-biblioref" class="link_bibr" href="workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1.xhtml#workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1-ref-40" id="Ref_workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1-ref-40">Carlson 1990</a>; <a role="doc-biblioref" class="link_bibr" href="workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1.xhtml#workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1-ref-76" id="Ref_workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1-ref-76">Elam 1980</a>; S. <a role="doc-biblioref" class="link_bibr" href="workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1.xhtml#workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1-ref-23" id="Ref_workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1-ref-23_1">Bennett 1990</a>). Of all subfields in philosophy of theatre, the phenomenology of theatre is arguably the most written about.

Questions remain about whether dramatic literature and theatrical performance are independent or dependent art forms (<a role="doc-biblioref" class="link_bibr" href="workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1.xhtml#workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1-ref-44" id="Ref_workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1-ref-44">Carroll 2001</a>; <a role="doc-biblioref" class="link_bibr" href="workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1.xhtml#workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1-ref-0113" id="Ref_workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1-ref-0113">Hamilton 2001</a>; <a role="doc-biblioref" class="link_bibr" href="workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1.xhtml#workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1-ref-204" id="Ref_workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1-ref-204">Saltz 2001</a>). Also, there are ideas about how to describe the relationship: token-type (<a role="doc-biblioref" class="link_bibr" href="workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1.xhtml#workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1-ref-69" id="Ref_workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1-ref-69">Dilworth 2002</a>), score (<a role="doc-biblioref" class="link_bibr" href="workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1.xhtml#workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1-ref-100" id="Ref_workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1-ref-100">Goodman 1968</a>), or other ways (<a role="doc-biblioref" class="link_bibr" href="workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1.xhtml#workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1-ref-242" id="Ref_workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1-ref-242">Worthen 2010</a>). Finally, the value of theatre has long been a cultural war that seesaws throughout Western history: ancient Greece and Rome, Medieval (distrust), Renaissance, Puritans (distrust), Enlightenment, and so on. Recently, however, in large part because of the “decline of the humanities” (whether real or perceived), there is renewed interest in value (for the first contemporary sustained book-length study on the value of theatre, see Woodruff 2008). Value and ethics also find their way into recent discussions about the societal value of theatre (<a role="doc-biblioref" class="link_bibr" href="workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1.xhtml#workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1-ref-72" id="Ref_workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1-ref-72">Dolan 2005</a>).</p></div></div>

For well over two thousand years, Aristotle’s <i>Poetics</i> has continued to inform and dominate the field of theatre studies and philosophy of theatre. Furthermore, not only are Plato’s ideas on the theatre important, but Plato’s dialogic form of writing has received new interest in twenty-first-century philosophy of theatre (see, particularly, <a role="doc-biblioref" class="link_bibr" href="workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1.xhtml#workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1-ref-183" id="Ref_workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1-ref-183">Puchner 2010</a>; <a role="doc-biblioref" class="link_bibr" href="workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1.xhtml#workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1-ref-187" id="Ref_workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1-ref-187">Rokem 2010</a>). The study of philosophy of theatre in ancient Rome was taken up, most notably and most influentially, by Seneca and Horace, who both looked to Aristotle’s <i>Poetics</i> as central to their respective interests in form and rhetoric (for a history of the legacy of, particularly Aristotle and Horace, see Carlson 1993). A key text that is more practical than the more theoretical <i>Poetics</i> of Aristotle, Horace’s text suggests that the dramatist must <i>instruct and delight</i> the audience (sometimes, though, translated as “instruct <i>or</i> delight”). Horace is interested in verisimilitude and differentiating dialogue that appropriately mirrors the position and disposition of the character.</p></div><div class="sec" id="workid-USAC0029927-book-part-4-sec-8"><header><h3 class="header sec hLevel3"><span class="title sec">Modern</span></h3></header><p class="para"><span class="para-id" id="workid-USAC0029927-book-part-4-target-17"></span>As stated above, the entire field of the philosophy of theatre begins with Plato, and even more so, Aristotle, and moves through Horace’s <i>Ars Poetica</i> (c. 15 <span class="smallCaps">bce</span>). These Greek and Roman pillars of thought on the theatre occupied, and continue to occupy, scholars over the millennia, but they certainly were central to thinkers through the Renaissance.

Nineteenth-century (especially, German) philosophers/writers—Nietzsche, Hegel, Goethe, and Schiller, among others—were integral to developing Romantic notions of theatre, which heavily informed and influenced the emergence of theatrical realism. Nietzsche’s <i>The Birth of Tragedy</i> is, arguably, after Aristotle’s <i>Poetics</i>, the most important and influential book on theatre.

Semiotics, which dominated studies in theatre theory from the 1970s to 1990s, rose concurrently with the growth of theories on structuralism and poststructuralism in literary studies (e.g., <a role="doc-biblioref" class="link_bibr" href="workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1.xhtml#workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1-ref-40" id="Ref_workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1-ref-40_1">Carlson 1990</a>; <a role="doc-biblioref" class="link_bibr" href="workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1.xhtml#workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1-ref-76" id="Ref_workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1-ref-76_1">Elam 1980</a>; S. <a role="doc-biblioref" class="link_bibr" href="workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1.xhtml#workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1-ref-23" id="Ref_workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1-ref-23_2">Bennett 1990</a>). Performance studies, developed in the 1990s and still a dominant field of theatre studies—or, in some ways, is now such an integral part of theatre studies that often the field is both called and thought of as “theatre and performance studies.” Performance studies emerged with the concurrent rise cultural studies and “critical theory”/Continental philosophy in literature departments and the rise in performance art. Much is also related to feminist and queer philosophers (e.g., Dolan, Case, and Phelan). <span aria-label="21" class="page" epub:type="pagebreak" id="workid-USAC0029927-book-part-4-target-031" role="doc-pagebreak" title="21"></span>The 2000s have seen what many have called the “philosophical turn” in theatre studies.

Finally, the 2010s have seen the emergence of “performance philosophy,” which is in part an offshoot of, in part subsumes, and in part just another name to call philosophy of theatre, though “performance philosophy” is decidedly organic and, thus, not quite a formal designation. “Performance philosophy” is the name of a discipline and the name of (all the same name) an online research network with over 2,500 members (<a aria-label="https://performancephilosophy.org (opens in new window)" class="uri" data-ext-link-type="uri" data-href="https://performancephilosophy.org" href="https://performancephilosophy.org" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="inline web-link-icon" src="media/web-link.svg" />https://performancephilosophy.org</a>), a peer-reviewed online journal, and a book series.</p></div></div>

Aristotle’s <i>Poetics</i> (c. 330 <span class="smallCaps">bce</span>), <span aria-label="22" class="page" epub:type="pagebreak" id="workid-USAC0029927-book-part-4-target-032" role="doc-pagebreak" title="22"></span>however, focuses largely on <i>mimesis</i> and still remains one of the foundational texts of theatre theorists, having been so, largely, throughout the centuries. While the question over the value of the theatre is no longer a question (e.g., see Paul Woodruff’s <i>The Necessity of Theater</i> [2008]), the debates over ideas about imitation, pretense, and mimesis form a vital spine to this day surrounding philosophical ideas about acting and theatre as a whole.</p><p class="para indented" data-content-type="indented"><span class="para-id" id="workid-USAC0029927-book-part-4-target-22"></span>The strength of this model—that is, mimesis—is that it is a familiar conceit, and while many types of theatre exist to the contrary, mimetic theatre <i>does</i> look and feel like real life, mirroring the embodied <i>liveness</i> of lived life.<a role="doc-noteref" class="endNote" href="workid-USAC0029927-book-part-13.xhtml#workid-USAC0029927-book-part-13-fn-5" id="fn_workid-USAC0029927-book-part-13-fn-5"><sup>2</sup></a> That is, in theatrical performance, real bodies move through actual space and progress through actual time. However, of course, the exceptions to mimetic theatre are some of the very reasons that this mimetic model of theatre falls apart, as so much of contemporary theatre and performance does not attempt to be mimetic. In fact, many of the major theatre theorists of the twentieth century, such as E. Gordon Craig and Bertolt Brecht (to name simply the most obvious), have actively sought ways in which to expose the theatre to its own artifice.</p><p class="para indented" data-content-type="indented"><span class="para-id" id="workid-USAC0029927-book-part-4-target-23"></span>Further, what is on the page and on the stage is not a mirror of nature (is not a reflection of the actual) but a (fictitious) re-creation of the actual, embodying concrete objects and actions, but in a way that the combination of these concrete objects and actions does not actually exist (and, hence, the <i>fictional</i> nature of fiction and theatre). That is, as I suggest in Bennett (2017), there is no way to reflect a fictional object back in a mirror. Mirrors and mimesis can only reflect what actually exists, and thus the mirror and mimetic model fall apart when faced with fiction (or, again, “re-creation”).</p></div><div class="sec" id="workid-USAC0029927-book-part-4-sec-12"><header><h3 class="header sec hLevel3"><span class="title sec"><span class="para-id" id="workid-USAC0029927-book-part-4-target-24"></span>Scores, Blueprints, Scripts</span></h3></header><p class="para"><span class="para-id" id="workid-USAC0029927-book-part-4-target-25"></span>In his seminal book on the philosophy of art, <i>Languages of Art</i> (1968), Nelson Goodman develops how to think about “two-stage <span aria-label="23" class="page" epub:type="pagebreak" id="workid-USAC0029927-book-part-4-target-033" role="doc-pagebreak" title="23"></span>art forms,” which include theatre.

While somewhat attractive for its simplicity, these models create a clear hierarchy of the primacy of the text to the (afterthought of) performance. Related to this, though not exactly the same, we can add the newer idea of an “<i>ingredients</i> model,” where theatre artists take the so-conceived “ingredients” from a dramatic text and <i>cook</i> them into final product (i.e., the performance).<a role="doc-noteref" class="endNote" href="workid-USAC0029927-book-part-13.xhtml#workid-USAC0029927-book-part-13-fn-6" id="fn_workid-USAC0029927-book-part-13-fn-6"><sup>3</sup></a> To be clear, the “ingredients” model is an epistemic one, particularly Hamilton’s version of it, and its use is to claim that theatrical performance is an independent art form, not merely a once-removed, or “second-stage,” art form in relationship to the dramatic text.</p><p class="para indented" data-content-type="indented"><span class="para-id" id="workid-USAC0029927-book-part-4-target-26"></span>These ideas about scores, blueprints, and scripts that created this idea about a “two-stage art form” were behind the now-seminal debates in the then-inchoate field of philosophy of theatre, where philosophers and theatre theorists debated the relationship between the dramatic text and theatrical performance, some thinking that the text was primary and others that the performance was its own art form (<a role="doc-biblioref" class="link_bibr" href="workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1.xhtml#workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1-ref-44" id="Ref_workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1-ref-44_2">Carroll 2001</a>; <a role="doc-biblioref" class="link_bibr" href="workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1.xhtml#workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1-ref-204" id="Ref_workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1-ref-204_2">Saltz 2001</a>; <a role="doc-biblioref" class="link_bibr" href="workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1.xhtml#workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1-ref-0113" id="Ref_workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1-ref-0113_2">Hamilton 2001</a>, 2007).<a role="doc-noteref" class="endNote" href="workid-USAC0029927-book-part-13.xhtml#workid-USAC0029927-book-part-13-fn-7" id="fn_workid-USAC0029927-book-part-13-fn-7"><sup>4</sup></a> In my book <i>Analytic Philosophy and the World of the Play</i> (2017), I largely develop the blueprint model but attempt to do so without creating a hierarchy of the relationship between the text and the performance, as the dramatic text and theatrical performances are all “re-creations.”</p></div><div class="sec" id="workid-USAC0029927-book-part-4-sec-13"><header><h3 class="header sec hLevel3"><span class="title sec"><span class="para-id" id="workid-USAC0029927-book-part-4-target-27"></span>Types and Tokens</span></h3></header><p class="para"><span class="para-id" id="workid-USAC0029927-book-part-4-target-28"></span>The idea of <i>types</i> and <i>tokens</i>, a stalwart concept found in many subfields in philosophy, was introduced to philosophical discussions surrounding the theatre largely by John Dilworth around the turn of the twenty-first century.

For example, compared to some so-called and so-conceived traditional plays that exist in both dramatic literature and theatrical performance, the following do not fit quite as nicely with the idea of “re-creation”: docudrama and/or verbatim theatre, devised theatre, and some one-person shows (which will be explored and explained in <a class="link_chapter" href="workid-USAC0029927-book-part-5.xhtml" id="Ref_workid-USAC0029927-book-part-5_5">Chapter 2</a>, on representation and presentation in the theatre).

Long thought to be the artistic activity that most mirrors real life, philosophers of theatre have recently started to question the supposed mimetic quality of theatre as an art form by asking, What sort of artistic activity is theatre? Related to theatre as a mimetic art form are two questions: What is acting, and How is it different from imitation, pretense, action-by-ideal, and so on?</p><p class="para indented" data-content-type="indented"><span class="para-id" id="workid-USAC0029927-book-part-4-target-104"></span>In “What Is Acting?” Yuchen Guo (2022) delineates the necessary and sufficient conditions of acting.

For Guo, the two necessary components of acting are that (1) the actor uses his or her own features to represent the features of the character that he or she is playing, and (2) the actor intends to have the audience believe that he or she is <i>identical</i> to the character that he or she is portraying. While Guo presents strong argumentation to back up these two necessary conditions of acting, Guo makes an (implied) assumption, and this is where I take issue, that theatrical acting is a mimetic activity. (Guo’s article goes well beyond the scope of just <i>theatrical</i> acting, but I limit my response to deal only with theatrical acting.) Guo does not specifically call acting a mimetic activity, however; Guo’s characterization that acting is the <i>identical</i> portrayal of a character certainly can imply that the actor apes or mimes the actions and words of the character.

For example, often one marvels at the technique of a virtuoso on the violin or piano, or one is in awe of the perfect technique of a professional golfer’s swing. However, in theatrical performance, to be successful, an actor must hide the fact that they are acting. If the audience recognizes the fact that the actor is acting—recognizing the techniques used to act in character—then the illusion of theatre is disrupted. This observation is important from the point of view of categorizing different art forms, specifically how theatre departs from other art forms. While Woodruff fully acknowledges that we tend to only notice acting when it is done poorly, it does seem that an argument can be made that audience members can still recognize technique by way of the <span aria-label="28" class="page" epub:type="pagebreak" id="workid-USAC0029927-book-part-4-target-038" role="doc-pagebreak" title="28"></span>negative, in that virtuosity in theatrical acting is equated with <i>not</i> noticing the acting.</p></div><div class="sec" id="workid-USAC0029927-book-part-4-sec-19"><header><h5 class="header sec hLevel5"><span class="label sec"><span class="para-id" id="workid-USAC0029927-book-part-4-target-117"></span>2</span> <span class="title sec"><i>Acting is a particular type of behavior.</i></span></h5></header><p class="para"><span class="para-id" id="workid-USAC0029927-book-part-4-target-118"></span>While there is agreement that acting is <i>particular type</i> of human behavior, there is disagreement as to which type of behavior acting is.

Hamilton develops a theory as to how audiences come to agreement on what they see on stage, as audiences, Hamilton claims, all pick out the same salient features of a performance (2007). Hamilton suggests that acting is a type of display behavior where an actor signals to the audience what to look for (2014, 2017). This is a compelling theory that explains a number of epistemological issues related to the viewing of theatre, yet my hesitation is two-fold: (1) this theory effectively translates into an acting technique that essentially forces actors to replicate <i>ideals</i> of gesture and intonation (i.e., creates something of a theory of action-by-ideals), which does not really fall in line with contemporary theories of (teaching) acting (also see Thom 2017), and (2) do audience members from different cultures (and/or socioeconomic environments) agree that the same display of behaviors means the same things?</p></div><div class="sec" id="workid-USAC0029927-book-part-4-sec-21"><header><h6 class="header sec hLevel6"><span class="label sec"><span class="para-id" id="workid-USAC0029927-book-part-4-target-121"></span>b</span> <span class="title sec"><i>Performance behavior</i></span></h6></header><p class="para"><span class="para-id" id="workid-USAC0029927-book-part-4-target-122"></span>Playing off Ludwig Wittgenstein’s notion of “pain behavior,” Spencer Golub suggests that performance gives public expression to private experience (<a role="doc-biblioref" class="link_bibr" href="workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1.xhtml#workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1-ref-99" id="Ref_workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1-ref-99_1">Golub 2014</a>). Golub’s idea is a powerful one in that Golub recognizes how theatre evokes feelings so intimate and personal, but, as I suggest in <a role="doc-biblioref" class="link_bibr" href="workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1.xhtml#workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1-ref-17" id="Ref_workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1-ref-17_1">Bennett (2021</a>), Golub appears to make an assumption that theatre is also a shared experience among audience members.

Saltz sees theatre as an agreement to play a game between actor and spectator, where everyone agrees to a set of rules to play the game. One key claim is that this agreement is only for the time of the play. That is, actors perform the same actions as the character, but in the context of the rules of the game. Saltz’s theory is an all-inclusive theory that touches upon major epistemological and ontological issues surrounding theatre. The only weakness in Saltz’s theory that I see, or could pose, is that why does theatre, simply, <i>feel</i> so different that other games we play? I do not have an answer to this here, but Saltz assumes something of a uniform audience, which I take some issue with, where (1) the audiences all agree to play the same game and (2) are equally equipped to play the same game (see <a role="doc-biblioref" class="link_bibr" href="workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1.xhtml#workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1-ref-17" id="Ref_workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1-ref-17_2">Bennett 2021</a>).</p></div></div><div class="sec" id="workid-USAC0029927-book-part-4-sec-23"><header><h5 class="header sec hLevel5"><span class="label sec"><span class="para-id" id="workid-USAC0029927-book-part-4-target-125"></span>3</span> <span class="title sec"><i>Acting is existing in a different way.</i></span></h5></header><p class="para"><span class="para-id" id="workid-USAC0029927-book-part-4-target-126"></span>Tzachi Zamir claims that, at base, repetition is the key to the acting experience. However, to Zamir, repetition is not simply duplication, but each repetition of an actor allows for the actor to experience something that they already knew “anew” (Zamir 2014: 367). I have, likewise, investigated the idea of “anew” in respect to modern history plays and how the actor and audience must constantly experience that which has already been completed (<a role="doc-biblioref" class="link_bibr" href="workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1.xhtml#workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1-ref-18" id="Ref_workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1-ref-18_2">Bennett 2012</a>).

The first sustained examination of the concept of “theatricality” and what it is for something to be “theatrical” (<a role="doc-biblioref" class="link_bibr" href="workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1.xhtml#workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1-ref-60" id="Ref_workid-USAC0029927-ref-list-1-ref-60">Davis and Postlewait 2004</a>) also brought the related idea of anti-theatricality that can be observed on the modern and contemporary stage (Ackerman and Puchner 2006). Following on the heels of these investigations into theatricality, the first contemporary book-length studies into theatre from a philosophical perspective emerged: James R. Hamilton’s <i>The Art of Theater</i> (2007) and Paul Woodruff’s <i>The Necessity of Theater</i> (2008), the latter of which defines the type of theatre he discusses in his book on the value of “mimetic theater.”</p><div class="sec" id="workid-USAC0029927-book-part-4-sec-25"><header><h4 class="header sec hLevel4"><span class="title sec"><span class="para-id" id="workid-USAC0029927-book-part-4-target-129"></span>Three Contemporary Views on Mimesis</span></h4></header><p class="para"><span class="para-id" id="workid-USAC0029927-book-part-4-target-130"></span>There is a spectrum of contemporary views on theatrical mimesis, from (1) theatrical mimesis exists (with the caveat that it is not always used for <a class="glossary-term" href="workid-USAC0029927-book-part-14.xhtml#workid-USAC0029927-book-part-14-term-27" id="Ref_workid-USAC0029927-book-part-14-term-27" role="doc-glossref">truth</a>) to (2) theatre is neutral with regard to mimesis to, finally, (3) theatre is not mimetic (but something else).</p></div><div class="sec" id="workid-USAC0029927-book-part-4-sec-26"><header><h4 class="header sec hLevel4"><span class="title sec"><span class="para-id" id="workid-USAC0029927-book-part-4-target-131"></span><i><span aria-label="31" class="page" epub:type="pagebreak" id="workid-USAC0029927-book-part-4-target-041" role="doc-pagebreak" title="31"></span>Theatre does, in fact, make use of mimesis, but not always for truth.</i></span></h4></header><p class="para"><span class="para-id" id="workid-USAC0029927-book-part-4-target-132"></span>The standard model of mimesis in theatre holds that holding up a mirror to nature exposes and reveals the truth about a situation.

That is, there is an ever-present tension between technique and mimesis, with the latter having to avoid exposing the former (Woodruff 2017: 111).</p></div><div class="sec" id="workid-USAC0029927-book-part-4-sec-28"><header><h4 class="header sec hLevel4"><span class="title sec"><span class="para-id" id="workid-USAC0029927-book-part-4-target-135"></span><i>Theatre does not make use of mimesis, but it makes use of something else.</i></span></h4></header><p class="para"><span class="para-id" id="workid-USAC0029927-book-part-4-target-136"></span>In <i>Analytic Philosophy and the World of the Play</i> (2017), I claim that theatre is not mimetic (i.e., does not reflect the world as would a mirror) and, instead, develop the idea that words, fictional entities, theatrical worlds, and possible worlds are all what I term “re-creation”: combinations of actually existing objects arranged in a manner that they do not actually exist except as <i>abstract objects</i>. What I attempt to accomplish is two-fold: first, my ontological model for theatre addresses the earlier debates about the relationship between dramatic text and performance (a foundational <span aria-label="32" class="page" epub:type="pagebreak" id="workid-USAC0029927-book-part-4-target-042" role="doc-pagebreak" title="32"></span>debate in the field of philosophy of theatre that was chronicled in Hamilton’s “The Text-Performance Relationship” in <i>Philosophy Compass</i> in 2009). By claiming that both a dramatic text and theatrical performances are re-creations, I attempt to eliminate this dividing line. Further, trying to reinforce this, I put both the text and the performance in the same class of objects, which provides a model for understanding how fictional objects (particularly in the theatre) exist and come into being, providing a seemingly more accurate description of the ontology and ontological status of theatre versus just a simple (though extremely long-lasting) metaphor that theatre is a mirror of nature.</p></div></div></div>
