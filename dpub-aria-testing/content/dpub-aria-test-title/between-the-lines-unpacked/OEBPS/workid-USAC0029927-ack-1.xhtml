<p class="para"><span class="para-id" id="workid-USAC0029927-ack-1-target-3"></span>This book has been the culmination of over a decade of my work on theatre studies and philosophy. As such, I have numerous people to thank (as in a sense, every person who helped me with all my scholarship over the past decade-plus), but most especially the following scholars (in alphabetical order) for their incisive feedback at many different stages of this specific book: Susan Feagin (Temple University); David Friedell (Union College); James R. Hamilton (Kansas State University); John Mackay (University of Wisconsin-Madison); Alan Sidelle (University of Wisconsin-Madison); and Karen Simecek (University of Warwick). I also want to thank Clare Hall (University of Cambridge) for providing an amazing intellectual environment in which I was able to draft much of this book, as well as thank my fellow Visiting Fellows and now friends: Juan Pablo Heras, Diana Carrió-Invernizzi, Hayden Bellenoit, Sara Vakhshouri, Cameron Buckner, Lindita Camaj, Anuj Bhuwania, Malini Aisola, Leslie Carlin, and Simon M. Coleman. Finally, I want to thank my wonderful editor at Oxford University Press, Lucy Randall, for her constant enthusiasm for this book, from submission all the way through to publication.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="para-id" id="workid-USAC0029927-ack-1-target-4"></span>As for the book itself, I would like to thank the following publishers and journals for letting me use some previously published material: <i>Philosophy and Literature</i> for allowing me to reprint two articles, “In Defense of Abstract Creationism: A Recombinatorial Approach,” which comprises a part of <a class="link_chapter" href="workid-USAC0029927-book-part-5.xhtml" id="Ref_workid-USAC0029927-book-part-5_1">Chapter 2</a>, and “Intrinsic-Extrinsic Properties in Theatre,” which comprises a part of <a class="link_chapter" href="workid-USAC0029927-book-part-11.xhtml" id="Ref_workid-USAC0029927-book-part-11_1">Chapter 7</a>; <i>Journal of Literary Semantics</i> for allowing me to reprint my article, “Propositions in Theatre: Theatrical Utterances <span aria-label="x" class="page" epub:type="pagebreak" id="workid-USAC0029927-ack-1-target-010" role="doc-pagebreak" title="x"></span>as Events,” which comprises part of <a class="link_chapter" href="workid-USAC0029927-book-part-9.xhtml" id="Ref_workid-USAC0029927-book-part-9_1">Chapter 5</a>; <i>Oxford Bibliographies</i> for allowing me to reprint some small sections from my article, “Philosophy of Theater,” found in <a class="link_chapter" href="workid-USAC0029927-book-part-4.xhtml" id="Ref_workid-USAC0029927-book-part-4_1">Chapter 1</a>; Routledge for allowing me to reprint some small sections of my book, <i>Analytic Philosophy and the World of the Play</i> (2017) in <a class="link_chapter" href="workid-USAC0029927-book-part-5.xhtml" id="Ref_workid-USAC0029927-book-part-5_2">Chapters 2</a> and <a class="link_chapter" href="workid-USAC0029927-book-part-9.xhtml" id="Ref_workid-USAC0029927-book-part-9_2">5</a> and some small sections of <i>The Problems of Viewing Performance: Epistemology and Other Minds</i> (2021) in <a class="link_chapter" href="workid-USAC0029927-book-part-6.xhtml" id="Ref_workid-USAC0029927-book-part-6_1">Chapter 3</a>; and Palgrave Macmillan for allowing me to reprint a very small section of <i>Narrating the Past through Theatre: Four Crucial Texts</i> (2012) in the Conclusion.</p>
<p class="para"><span class="para-id" id="workid-USAC0029927-ack-1-target-5"></span>Of course, a book like this cannot be completed, or even take off, without the help of friends, family, and loved ones. I want to start by thanking my parents, Jeffrey and Debra Bennett, as well as my sister, Anna Bennett, and my brother-in-law, Steven M. Fischer, for their steadfast love and support, as well as my closest friends over the past decade or more: Eyal Tamir, Colin Enriquez, Joel Anderson, Jeremy Church, Shai Cohen, Lauren Roth, Mike Musgrave, Steve Rosenlund, Stephen Lommele, Katie Bond, Louis Betty, Maija Birenbaum, Tanya Kam, and Elena Levy-Navarro. Now, too, I get to add my love, Carrie, and her son, Cole, to this list of amazing people who have made this book what it is. Ultimately, though, my sons, Maxwell and Julius, have been my guiding light over the past decade of my life: you are both my everything, and I love you more than you can ever imagine.</p></section></body></html><!--This epub package was generated by the OUP JYTS Application version 12.0 on 2024/08/19 22:16:06 Using  OUP Academic ePub style and the following user options: chunkLevel=chapter, addTitlePage=no, addCopyrightPage=no, addKeytermsList=no, addIllustrationsList=yes, addTablesList=yes, addVideosList=yes, addAudiosList=yes, addEndPageIllustrations=no, scaleImages=yes, addDataSmil=no, displayContribList=no, addGlossRevLink=no, addTextPopOver=no, addInlineframe=No, addInlineAudio=no, addAnswerShowHide=no, addHintShowHide=no -->
