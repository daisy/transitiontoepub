	</head>
	<body>
		<h1>DPUB ARIA Test Suite</h1>
		<h2>Background</h2>
		<p>Books and other publications have constructs such as chapters, parts, footnotes and more that are not commonly found on web pages. The visual presentation of these constructs makes it obvious to the sighted reader what the semantics are. These semantic constructs can now be added to HTML and XHTML by using <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dpub-aria-1.1/#roles">DPUB Aria roles</a> and then used for presentation through Assistive Technology. The <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/publishingcg/">Publishing Community Group</a> at the W3C continues to promote these roles for browsers, in EPUB Reading Systems, and for published digital materials.</p>
		<p>To improve the reading experience for screen reader users, the presentation of these semantic constructs is recommended. Some of the roles are extremely important to present to the reader, while others are of less importance. The <a href="https://daisy.org/activities/projects/ties/">Transition to Accessible EPUB working group</a> in the DAISY Consortium is making suggestions as to the importance of the roles and what might be presented. This XHTML document provides the necessary information that screen reader implementors should consider. This document can also be used for testing purposes. Each item should be self-explanatory and indicate the (1) importance and (2) what should be presented.</p>
		<h2>Screen Reader Implementation</h2>
		<p>This HTML page is designed to assist implementers of Assistive Technology such as screen readers to vocalize the DPUB Aria roles on web pages and in EPUB publications. There are currently 39 DPUB Aria roles which are prefixed with "doc-" before the publishing construct, e.g. "doc-chapter" for a chapter. A list of the roles, their importance, suggested output, actions to be considered, and support in 
			browsers can be found at: <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1atUkcAbkHpS5eUJ1rdDCrQ3saY8HZEMTNtWkanASLo4/edit?usp=sharing">Google Sheet showing DPUB Aria roles and suggestions for implementors.</a>
		</p>
		<p> Importance of vocalizing or presenting constructs</p>
		<ol>
			<li>critical: should always be presented,</li>
			<li>high: should be presented most of the time,</li>
			<li>medium: should be presented some of the time,</li>
			<li>low: should be presented with the highest verbosity setting.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>The following are presented for testing purposes. Included in the example is a description of the test, its importance, and suggested output, which corresponds to the Google sheet linked above.</p>
